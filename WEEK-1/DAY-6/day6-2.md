# Performing Transactions Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## Introduction

Performing transactions using the command-line interface (CLI) offers a convenient way to interact with a blockchain network directly from your terminal. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to initiate transactions using CLI commands.

## Prerequisites

Before performing transactions via CLI, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the CLI tools for the specific blockchain network (e.g., Solana CLI, Ethereum CLI).
- A configured wallet with sufficient balance or test tokens for executing transactions.
- Knowledge of the recipient's wallet address (if sending tokens).

## Steps to Perform Transactions

### 1. **Access CLI**

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your CLI tools are installed.

### 2. **Connect to the Network**

Use the appropriate CLI command to connect to the desired blockchain network. For example:
```bash
solana config set --url <network_url>
```

### 3. **Check Balance (Optional)**

Before sending tokens, you may want to check your wallet balance using the following command:
```bash
solana balance
```

### 4. **Initiate Transaction**

To send tokens to another wallet, use the transaction command with the recipient's address and the amount to send. For example:
```bash
solana transfer <recipient_address> <amount>
```

### 5. **Confirm Transaction**

Review the transaction details displayed in the terminal, including the recipient's address, amount, and transaction fee. Confirm the transaction by entering 'yes' or 'confirm' when prompted.

### 6. **Transaction Confirmation**

After confirming the transaction, the CLI will initiate the transfer process. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain network. You may receive a transaction ID (TXID) for reference.

### 7. **Check Transaction Status (Optional)**

You can verify the status of your transaction using the appropriate CLI command. For example:
```bash
solana transaction <TXID>
```

### 8. **Transaction Completion**

Once the transaction is confirmed, the tokens will be transferred to the recipient's wallet. You can also verify the updated balance in your wallet using the balance command.

## Tips for Transaction Execution

- **Double-check Details**: Ensure accuracy in recipient addresses and transaction amounts before confirming.
- **Transaction Fees**: Be aware of transaction fees and adjust gas prices accordingly to expedite or prioritize transactions.
- **Network Connectivity**: Maintain stable internet connectivity to avoid transaction failures or interruptions.
- **Security Measures**: Keep your private keys secure and avoid sharing them with unauthorized individuals.


# Tracking and Documenting the Transaction Process

## Introduction

Tracking and documenting the transaction process on a blockchain network is essential for maintaining transparency, auditability, and accountability. This guide provides instructions on how to track transactions and document the process effectively.

## Tracking Transactions

### 1. **Transaction ID (TXID)**

- Every transaction on a blockchain network is assigned a unique Transaction ID (TXID).
- The TXID serves as a reference to track the status and details of a specific transaction.

### 2. **Blockchain Explorer**

- Use a blockchain explorer tool provided by the network (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum, Solscan for Solana) to track transactions.
- Enter the TXID in the search bar to view transaction details, including sender, recipient, amount, gas fees, and status.

### 3. **CLI Commands**

- Some blockchain CLI tools allow users to query transaction details directly from the command line interface.
- Use the appropriate CLI command followed by the TXID to retrieve transaction information.

## Documenting the Transaction Process

### 1. **Transaction Details**

- Record key details of the transaction, including sender's address, recipient's address, amount transferred, gas fees, and timestamp.
- Ensure accuracy in documenting transaction details to facilitate auditing and analysis.

### 2. **Transaction Status**

- Document the current status of the transaction, such as pending, confirmed, or failed.
- Update the status as the transaction progresses through the network.

### 3. **Transaction Logs**

- Maintain transaction logs or a chronological record of all transactions initiated or received.
- Include relevant information such as TXID, status, timestamp, and any additional notes.

### 4. **Audit Trail**

- Create an audit trail documenting the transaction process from initiation to completion.
- Include transaction details, communication exchanges, and any actions taken during the transaction lifecycle.

### 5. **Security Measures**

- Implement security measures to protect transaction documentation, such as encryption, access controls, and regular backups.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and industry standards.

## Best Practices for Tracking and Documentation

- **Real-Time Updates**: Track transaction status and document updates in real-time to maintain accuracy and transparency.
- **Cross-Verification**: Verify transaction details across multiple sources, such as blockchain explorers and CLI commands, to ensure consistency.
- **Version Control**: Maintain version control of transaction documentation to track changes and revisions over time.
- **Collaboration**: Foster collaboration among stakeholders involved in the transaction process to facilitate accurate documentation and resolution of discrepancies.
