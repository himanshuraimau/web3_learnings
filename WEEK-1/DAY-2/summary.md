Decentralization is a transformative concept that shifts control and authority from a single central point to a distributed network. This approach offers numerous benefits, including enhanced security, transparency, and resilience, while reducing the risk of censorship and single points of failure. By leveraging decentralization, various industries and systems can achieve greater efficiency, trust, and robustness.
